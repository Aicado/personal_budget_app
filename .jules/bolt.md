## 2025-05-14 - [DuckDB FULL OUTER JOIN vs Python Merging]
**Learning:** Replacing Python-level dictionary merging with a single SQL `FULL OUTER JOIN` in DuckDB significantly improves the performance of cross-table status checks. However, when joining on columns that may contain NULL values (like optional paths), standard `=` comparisons fail.
**Action:** Always use `IS NOT DISTINCT FROM` for join conditions in DuckDB when the join keys might contain NULL values to ensure behavior matches Python dictionary merging.
