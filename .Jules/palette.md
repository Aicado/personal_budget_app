## 2025-05-15 - [Tab Navigation Accessibility]
**Learning:** Adding redundant `aria-label` or `title` attributes to buttons that already contain visible text causes screen readers to announce the label twice, creating a poor user experience. ARIA labels should be reserved for icon-only elements or to provide missing context.
**Action:** Always check if a component has visible text before adding `aria-label`. Ensure `tabpanel` elements are focusable if they contain large amounts of content to aid keyboard navigation.

## 2025-05-16 - [Responsive Label Accessibility]
**Learning:** Using `display: none` to hide text labels on mobile (leaving only icons) makes elements inaccessible to screen readers. A "visually-hidden" CSS pattern should be used instead to keep the text in the accessibility tree while hiding it from the screen.
**Action:** Use absolute positioning and clipping to hide text labels on small viewports instead of `display: none`. Revert to `static` positioning on larger screens where labels should be visible.

## 2025-05-17 - [Data Visualization Accessibility]
**Learning:** For static data visualizations representing a measurement within a known range (e.g., spending categories), `role="meter"` is more semantic than `role="progressbar"`. Adding `aria-valuenow`, `aria-valuemin`, `aria-valuemax`, and a descriptive `aria-label` ensures these visual elements are accessible to screen reader users.
**Action:** Use `role="meter"` for static visualizations and `role="progressbar"` for ongoing tasks. Always provide quantitative values via ARIA attributes and a clear text label.

## 2025-05-24 - [Empty State Recovery & PR Scope]
**Learning:** When filters result in an empty state, users often feel "stuck" if they have to navigate back to the top of the page to reset. An immediate recovery action (e.g., "Show All") within the empty state message prevents dead-ends. Additionally, broad refactoring of lint errors unrelated to the UX change can obscure the core improvement and lead to configuration churn.
**Action:** Always provide a one-click recovery path in filtered empty states. Limit PR scope strictly to the targeted UX fix to avoid "stylistic churn" and unrelated lockfile changes.
